### Lys

**Hello!** ðŸ‘‹ 

Lys is a small project I'm working on. It works like an Audible for articles. It's a prototype marketplace allowing people to submit and save articles they want to "hear" later. In the meantime, others can record themselves reading it.

**Idea** ðŸ¤”

I am a user of save-for-later article readers. However, I like to listen to the articles on the move. The text-to-speech function of these apps is not great. I though this could be a good solution.
